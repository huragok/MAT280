% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

  In this work, we attempt to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of the
  taxi trips data of New York City (NYC) throughout 2014. Our primary goal is to
  find the vibrant neighborhoods favored by New Yorkers during night time. By
  adopting spectral clustering, we successfully identify the ``day-time''
  neighborhoods and the ``night-time'' neighborhoods in NYC, which is reasonably
  in accordance with the reality.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
% Motivation and literature review for Two-way relay-HARQ. HARQ first,
% then two-way relay
\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the availability of a wide range of public civic data
sets and open source tools for data science, nowadays anyone with a fundamental
knowledge/experience on statistics and programming is well-equipped to
``learn'' about a city in various aspects, a realm used to be dominated primarily by
professional data scientists and/or urban planners. In this work, we consider
the general problem of identifying the ``active'' neighborhoods in NYC during
the night time. An answer to it can be made use of, for example, by
tourists seeking for exciting nightlife, new residents looking for a quiet
neighborhood, taxi drivers to locate prospective passengers, or city
planners to predict traffic, to name a few.

A simple approach to answer this question qualitatively, of course, is to ask
the locals or search for an answer on Google or TripAdvisor, etc. However, to
get a more quantative, founded and potentially more useful answer, we take a
rigorous approach to look for it from the (NYC) Taxi \& Limousine Commission
(TLC) Trip Record Data~\cite{nyctlc} during 2014 and the 2010 NYC Census Tracts
(CTs) maps~\cite{nyc2010ct}. The number of taxi pickup and dropoffs per hour are
used as an indicator on how active each CT is. Most analysis on
similar datasets are based on supervised learning, such as the MIT 2013-2014 Big
Data Challenge~\cite{mit2013bigdata}, a related course
project~\cite{grinberg2014predicting}, as well as the recent algorithm
competition by DiDi Research~\cite{didi2016algorithm}. On the contrary, our
analysis is primarily based on a simple but effective unsupervised learning
technique, namely spectral clustering. With straightforward visualization
results, we successfully reveal the distinct ``day-time'' and ``night-time''
neighborhoods of NYC.

The rest of this report is organized as follows. Section II introduces the data
sets and techniques we used to clean and import the data. Section III describes
how we adopt the spectral-clustering method to cluster the CTs into two groups
according to the pickup-dropoff patterns.
Numerical results are provided in Section IV, which clearly shows that the two
distinct clusters of the busiest CTs indeed represent the neighborhoods more
active during daytime/nighttime. Finally, Section V concludes the report.

\section{The Data Sets}
\label{sec:data}
The primary dataset studied in this project is the NYC TLC Trip Record
Data~\cite{nyctlc} during 2014 including both the yellow and green taxi trips,
which in csv formats amount to a total of around 25GB. Among various fields, we
are mainly interested in the pickup/dropoff time and location of each trip.
Also, as the original data consists of trips of both yellow and green taxi,
which have different modus operandi and coverage~\cite{quora_difference},
each record of trip is also labeled as ``yellow'' or ``green''. 

In order to analyze the taxi trips at a proper spatial granularity, we adopt the
2010 NYC census tracts map~\cite{nyc2010ct} which divides the city into 2166
CTs as in~\cite{schneider2015analyzing}, each composed of around 5-10 blocks. To
enable efficient manipulations of the data, especially mapping the longitude and
latitude of each pickup and dropoff to a CT, the trip data are firstly written
into a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension using Python package
\texttt{sqlalchemy} with \texttt{geoalchemy2}. After data cleansing, a total of
176493349 records are inserted into the database. The CT map in shapefile
format is added to the database directly with \texttt{shp2pgsql} data loader.

\section{Distinguish Neighborhoods Vibrant in the Night}
\label{sec:distribution}
\subsection{Spatial-Temporal Distribution of Taxi Trips}
We count the number of pickups and dropoffs for each hour of the day (0-23) for
each CT (1-2166) averaged over the 365 days of 2014. The results are represented
as a 2166-by-48 matrix $\mathbf{C}$, where $C_{i,j+1}$ and $C_{i,25+j}$,
$i\in[1, 2166],$, $j\in[0,23]$ represent the average number of pickups/dropoffs in
the $i$-th CT from $j$ to $j+1$, respectively. Denote the 2166-by-1 vector
$\mathbf{s}$ as the area of each CT, then the average density of
pickups/dropoffs, namely $\mbox{diag}(\mathbf{s})\mathbf{C}$, for yellow and
green taxis are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:density_pickup_yellow},
Fig.~\ref{fig:density_dropoff_yellow}, Fig.~\ref{fig:density_pickup_green} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:density_dropoff_green}, respectively.

In order to explore the temporal pattern of the taxi trips, each row of
$\mathbf{C}$ is normalized to have sum of 1, resulting in $\bar{\mathbf{C}} =
[\mbox{diag}(\mathbf{C1})]^{-1}\mathbf{C}$, where $\mathbf{1}$ is a 48-by-1
all-one vector. Also as shown in the density maps, for both
yellow and green taxi most pickups and dropoffs are highly concentrated in a
few CTs. Consequently, we focus only on the most popularized CTs, i.e. we select
a subset of rows from $\bar{\mathbf{C}}$ as $\bar{\mathbf{C}}_S$. For yellow
taxi, we select all $N_S = 81$ CTs with average daily total pickups/dropoffs
greater than 4500. For green taxi, we select all $N_S = 44$ CTs with average
daily total pickups/dropoffs greater than 300.

  \label{fig:density_dropoff_green}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spectral Clustering}
To group the CTs based on their daily pickup/dropoff patterns, we perform
spectral clustering~\cite{von2007tutorial} on $\bar{\mathbf{C}}_S$ for yellow
and green taxi, respectively. Specifically, we evaluate the $N_S$-by-$N_S$ Gaussian radial
basis function (rbf) distance matrix $\mathbf{W}$ where
\begin{align}
  W_{i,j} = \exp\left(\frac{\|\mathbf{c}_i -
  \mathbf{c}_j\|_2^2}{\epsilon}\right)
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{c}_i$, $\mathbf{c}_j$ are the $i$, $j$-th row of
$\bar{\mathbf{C}}_S$. Then we apply k-means on $\mathbf{v}$, namely the second
principle eigen-vector of $\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{D} - \mathbf{W}$, where the
diagonal degree matrix $\mathbf{D} = \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{W1})$. The parameter
$\epsilon$ is selected by examining the historgram of entries of $\mathbf{v}$.
In our case, we select $\epsilon$ to be 180 times the median of $\|\mathbf{c}_i
- \mathbf{c}_j\|_2^2$ for yellow taxi trips and 160 times the median for green
taxi trips.
% Outline

\section{Numerical Results}
\label{sec:numerical}
The histogram of the entries of $\mathbf{v}$ for yellow taxi and green taxi are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:hist_yellow} and Fig.~\ref{fig:hist_green},
respectively. The spectral clustering indeed identifies two clusters, and the
corresponding CTs are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:coloring_yellow} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:coloring_green} with Python's \texttt{matplotlib} library with
\texttt{Basemap} toolkits. Cluster 0 primarily includes upper and middle
Manhattan, JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and the north-west part of Queens
and Brooklyn. Cluster 1, on the other hand, primarily includes certain areas
of West Village, East Village and Williamsburg. By examining the temporal
variation of pickups and dropoffs for the two clusters as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:curve_yellow} and Fig.~\ref{fig:curve_green}, the two clusters are
different in the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cluster 0 has more pickups/dropoffs during the day time (5:00-17:00)
  than cluster 1.
  \item Both the pickup/dropoff curve reach their peak at around 18:00/19:00 for
  cluster 0. In comparison, for cluster 1, the pickup curve reaches its peak at
  around 0:00, while the drop off curve reaches its peak at around 20:00.
\end{itemize}

Consequently, it is reasonable to argue that cluster 0 represents the most
popularized ``day-time'' neighborhoods of NYC while cluster 1 represents the most
popularized ``night-time'' neighborhoods. This is also in accordance with
the results shown in the ``NYC Late Night Taxi Index'' section
of~\cite{schneider2015analyzing}. To further justify the clustering results, we
plot the top 20 most reviewed bars/lounges, dance clubs and formal restaurants
from Yelp in Fig.~\ref{fig:tag}. The ``night-time'' cluster of 13 CTs found by
the spectral clustering algorithm contains around 1/3 of the 60 most reviewed
hotspots, while the business area of midtown-midtown south and the Financial
districts are correctly (heuristically) classified as the ``day-time''
neighborhoods. However, we admit that the spectral clustering method
adopted here is rather sensitive to the choice of parameter $N_S$ and
$\epsilon$, and the interpretation of the results is subjective as in most
unsupervised learning techniques. More rigorous approaches to similar
problems can be found in~\cite{Yuan:2012:DRD:2339530.2339561} and the references
therein.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we studied the problem of infering the nightlife hotspot in New
York City by making use of the NYC taxi data in 2014. By extracting the daily
pickup/dropoff patterns sampled hourly and adopting the spectral clustering
algorithm on the high dimensional (48) feature, we are able to reasonably
cluster the CTs into the ``day-time'' and ``night-time'' neighborhoods. 
% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

%\begin{table}[!t]

%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively. 
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
